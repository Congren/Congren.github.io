                        <p>Graphical displays of quantitative information take on many forms as they help us understand both data and models. This course will serve to introduce the student to the most common forms of graphical displays and their uses and misuses. Students will learn both how to create these displays and how to understand them. As time permits the course will consider some more advanced graphical methods such as computer-generated animations. Each student will be required to engage in a project using graphical methods to understand data collected from a real scientific or engineering experiment. In addition to two weekly lectures there will be lab sessions where the students learn to use software to aid in the production of appropriate graphical displays.</p>

                        <p>This course will complement the technical and diagnostic skills you have learned in other courses. A basic premise of the course is that, while you will need analytical skills to discover optimal solutions to problems, you will also need a broad array of negotiation skills to implement these solutions and make sure that they are truly effective. Your long-term effectiveness - both in your professional and personal life - is likely to depend on your negotiating abilities. This course will give you the opportunity to develop these skills experientially and to understand the analytical frameworks that underlie negotiations.</p>

The firm grounding in the fundamentals is aimed at providing students the flexibility to build and analyze models from diverse applications as well as preparing the interested student for advanced work in these areas. The course will cover core concepts such as probability spaces, random variables, random vectors, multivariate densities, distributions, expectations, sampling and simulation; independence, conditioning, conditional distributions and expectations; limit theorems such as the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem; as well as additional topics such as large deviations, random walks and Markov chains, as time permits. 3 hrs. lec.</p>

To diagnose injuries and perform surgery when human doctors are not around? Who should be permitted to observe you, find out who your friends are, what you do and say with them, what you buy, and where you go? Do social media and personalized search restrict our intellectual horizons? Do we live in polarizing information bubbles, just hearing echoes of what we already know and believe? As computing technology becomes ever more pervasive and sophisticated, we are presented with an escalating barrage of decisions about who, how, when, and for what purposes technology should be used. This course will provide an intellectual framework for discussing these pressing issues of our time, as we shape the technologies that in turn shape us. We will seek insight through reading, discussion, guest lectures, and debates. Students will also undertake an analysis of a relevant issue of their choice, developing their own position, and acquiring the research skills needed to lend depth to their thinking. The course will enhance students' ability to think clearly about contentious technology choices, formulate smart positions, and support their views with winning arguments.</p>

                        <p>This course is designed to develop skills related to entrepreneurship and innovation for non-business undergraduate and graduate students in the School of Computer Science. The course assumes no background courses in business and is appropriate for those who are interested in bringing innovations to market either through new companies or existing companies. The course provides an overview of entrepreneurship and innovation, develops an entrepreneurial frame of mind, and provides a framework for learning the rudiments of how to generate ideas. Students come up with or are presented with potential ideas and learn how to develop these ideas into opportunities, and to explore their potential for becoming viable businesses. They learn how to do market research, to develop go-to-market strategies, value propositions and to differentiate their products or services from potential competitors. The focus is on understanding and developing strategies for approaching the key elements of the entrepreneurial process...opportunity, resources and team. The course consists of a balance of lectures, case studies and encounters with entrepreneurs, investors and business professionals. The students are exposed to financial and intellectual property issues, and encounter a real world perspective on entrepreneurship, innovation and leadership. The output of the course is a mini-business plan or venture opportunity screening document that can be developed into a business plan in a subsequent course entitled New Venture Creation or through independent study.</p>
