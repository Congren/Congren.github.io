                <p>Information systems (IS) are changing work practices, reshaping organizations, transforming cultures, 
                    and giving new meaning to the ways we see the world. This course is designed to help students understand the role of 
                    IS in modern society and the means by which these systems are created. It provides not only a framework for understanding 
                    information and information systems, but also a language to identify their dynamic complexities and inter-dependencies. 
                    Topics include: current trends in IS, structured approaches to the creation of IS, corporate IS competitive advantage, 
                    business process improvements/re-engineering, eCommerce and the digital economy, knowledge management, decisions support 
                    systems, and the implications of IS for people, organizations and society. Classes will use a combination of lectures, 
                    class discussions, reading assignments, case studies, group projects, and "hands-on" work in database design. This course 
                    is a required professional core course for IS freshmen only.</p>

                            communications have transformed every aspect of our modern life. This course provides a 
                            comprehensive introduction to basic principles of telecommunications technology and the 
                            legal, economic, and regulatory environment of todays networks. Topics covered include 
                            the fundamentals of communication network technologies, including video, voice, and 
                            computer networks; principles behind telecommunications regulation from common carrier 
                            law and natural monopoly to information diversity, privacy and national security; traffic 
                            differentiation on the Internet and the debate over network neutrality; universal service 
                            and the digital divide; mergers, antitrust, and the changing industrial structure of the 
                            communications sector. We will explore current topical questions such as the future of 
                            competition in broadband access; the shift of entertainment video from cable and 
                            satellite to Internet delivery; how cloud computing concepts are transforming networks; 
                            and communications support for the Internet of Things. Comparison with European 
                            approaches to communications regulation. Special emphasis on how new technologies have 
                            altered, and are altered by, regulation. Junior or Senior standing required.</p>

Classes will cover delivering engaging presentations, writing emails co-workers want to read, conducting meetings and workshops, delivering criticism and more.This mini course requires students to participate in a combination of readings, discussions, in-class simulations, theater exercises, individual and group projects to practice soft skills.

Students explore the current standards and best practices of web design. Throughout the course, students work with HTML5, CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap, and Javascript, and learn how the various web components function together. The course utilizes a hands-on approach to guide students through learning and understanding the design and development process. This course is primarily designed for students with minimal technical experience. By the end of the course, students will be able to plan, design, and implement a basic functioning mobile web site/ app.</p>

Through displaying layers of information in computer generated maps, we can see, analyze, understand and explore spatial patterns and relationships in new and novel ways. People in many different fields use Geographical Information Systems in their work: for visualizing the environment, human development, demographics, traffic and transportation, public health and many more. In this course, students will learn the basics of GIS through hands-on experience with popular mapping tools. Sources of data, principles of coordinate and projection systems and elementary geo-analysis techniques will be included. Upon completion of the course, students will have the background to begin using GIS techniques in their own areas of interest and will be prepared for further study in advanced GIs courses.</p>
